Steps to Install Node.js and Angular CLI in WSL



Update WSL Package List:Open your WSL terminal (e.g., Ubuntu) and update the package list:
```bash
sudo apt update
```
# Install Node.js:


Use a version manager like nvm (Node Version Manager) for easier management:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 20.19.3
nvm use 20.19.3
```


# Verify the installation:
```bash
node -v
```

Should output: v20.19.3.


# Verify npm (Node Package Manager) is installed:
```bash
npm -v
```

Should output a version (e.g., 10.x.x).


# Install the Angular CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@19.2.15
```


# Verify the installation:
```bash
ng version
```

Should output Angular CLI version 19.2.15.


# Clone the repository:

# Starting the Development Server

To start a local development server, run:
